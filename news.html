        <h3>Basic Schools Revert to Old Curriculum Amidst Confusion</h3>
        <p class="snippet">Teachers across Ghana have been left scrambling after a sudden directive to abandon the new standards-based curriculum and return to the old one. With months of lessons already taught under the new system, many educators now face the challenge of adjusting plans, re-teaching content, and managing confused pupils—all without updated materials or training. The shift has sparked frustration and calls for clearer communication from education authorities.</p>
        <div class="details">In a surprising turn of events, basic schools across the country have been directed to revert to the old curriculum, sparking confusion among teachers, parents, and education stakeholders. The decision comes after months of uncertainty surrounding the full implementation of the new standards-based curriculum introduced in recent years.

Many teachers, who had already adapted their lesson plans and teaching methods to the new curriculum, now face the challenge of undoing months of instruction and readjusting to the old framework. Some schools have expressed concern about the lack of clear communication, training, and adequate teaching materials to support such a reversal.

Despite these concerns, the Ghana Education Service has emphasized the need to ensure consistency in learning while efforts are made to address ongoing gaps in the new curriculum rollout. The sudden shift has reignited conversations about the preparedness of the education sector for reforms and the need for stronger stakeholder engagement in national curriculum decisions.

As schools work to adjust, parents and teachers alike are calling for transparency, stability, and timely resource allocation to minimize the impact on learners’ progress.</div>
